## Description: 
Project:Decision making in business
In this project, we will analyze the data of a large online store. Our goal is to prepare a list of hypotheses, run an A/B test and analyze the results to increase revenue.

## Conclusion
Decision: Stop the test, record the victory of one of the groups. There is a significant difference in conversion between the groups on both raw and post-filtering anomaly data, with Group B converting higher than Group A. No statistically significant difference was found in average check between groups on either the raw or post-filtering anomaly data. However, the average check in group B is higher than in group A. Based on this information, it is recommended to stop the test and record the victory of group B, as its conversion rate is significantly higher than that of group A.
